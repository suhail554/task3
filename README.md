OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT:create a C++ program for building a simple console -based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.

OBJECTIVES:Here are the key objectives for a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++:

1. **Display the Game Board**: Create and display a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

2. **Player Input**: Allow two players to take turns entering their moves, choosing a cell to place their marker (X or O).

3. **Update Board**: Update the board with the players' moves after each turn.

4. **Check for Win**: Determine if a player has won by checking for three of the same marker in a row, column, or diagonal.

5. **Check for Draw**: Determine if the game is a draw when all cells are filled and no player has won.

6. **Handle Invalid Input**: Ensure the input is valid (e.g., choosing an empty cell) and prompt the player to enter a correct move if necessary.

7. **Display Results**: Announce the winner or if the game ends in a draw, and display the final state of the board.

8. **Replay Option**: Allow players to start a new game or exit after the game ends.
